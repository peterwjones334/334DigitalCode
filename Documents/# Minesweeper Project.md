## About Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that originated in the 1960s and gained popularity with the release of Microsoft Windows. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular grid containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. Players reveal the cells on the grid by clicking on them, and the numbers displayed in each cell indicate how many mines are adjacent to that particular cell. By using deductive reasoning and logical thinking, players aim to uncover all non-mine cells and mark the locations of the mines. It's a challenging and addictive game that requires careful strategy to solve.

The computer game that was originally developed by Microsoft. The game was created by Robert Donner and later included as a standard application in the Microsoft Windows operating system starting from Windows 3.1. As such, Minesweeper is owned by Microsoft Corporation.

The concept of the Minesweeper game, which involves clearing a minefield without detonating any mines, is not owned by any individual or company. The game concept itself is considered a classic puzzle game and has been implemented by various developers and companies over the years. While Microsoft popularized the Minesweeper game by including it in their Windows operating system, the concept of the game is not exclusive to them, and anyone is free to create their own implementation of the game.

The Minesweeper game is primarily known by its original name, "Minesweeper." However, there are variations and similar games with different names that follow the same or similar gameplay mechanics.

Some of the alternative names for games that share similarities with Minesweeper include:

- Minefield
- Mine Detection
- Mine Clearing
- Mine Buster
- Bomb Sweeper
- Mine Hunter
- Mine Disarmer
- Minefield Navigator

These are just a few examples, and there may be other localized or unofficial names for similar games. However, "Minesweeper" remains the most widely recognized and commonly used name for this type of game.

## Architecture

Here's a high-level software architecture for a Minesweeper game:

User Interface (UI) Layer:

Handles user interactions and displays the game grid, flags, and other relevant information.
Receives user input, such as mouse clicks or touch events, to reveal cells or place flags.
Notifies the game logic layer of user actions and updates the UI based on game state changes.

Game Logic Layer:

Manages the game state and implements the game rules.
Generates and maintains the game grid, including the mine placements and cell information.
Processes user actions from the UI layer, such as revealing cells or flagging them.
Determines the outcome of the game (win, loss, or ongoing) based on the user's actions.
Provides relevant game events or notifications to the UI layer.

Persistence Layer:

Handles the storage and retrieval of game data, such as high scores, game settings, and user profiles.
Stores and loads game states to allow for saving and resuming games.

AI (Artificial Intelligence) Layer (optional):

Implements an AI algorithm to provide hints or automatically solve the Minesweeper game.
Can be used to assist the player or act as a computer opponent.

Utilities and Helpers:

Contains various utility functions and helper classes to support the other layers.
Includes functions for generating random mine placements, calculating adjacent mine counts, etc.

The overall architecture promotes a separation of concerns, allowing for modular development and easier maintenance. The UI layer interacts with the user and displays the game, while the game logic layer handles the game rules and state management. The persistence layer handles data storage, and the AI layer (optional) provides additional features. Utilities and helper functions support the other layers by providing common functionality.

Keep in mind that this is a general architectural outline, and there may be variations or additional components based on specific implementation requirements.

## Use Cases & User Stories

Here are some example use cases and user stories for a Minesweeper game based on the software architecture mentioned earlier:

Use Case: Start a New Game

User Story: As a player, I want to start a new game of Minesweeper.
Description: The player initiates a new game either by clicking a "New Game" button or selecting a difficulty level. The game logic layer generates a new game grid with random mine placements and initializes the necessary data structures. The UI layer updates the display to show the new game grid.

Use Case: Reveal a Cell

User Story: As a player, I want to reveal a cell by left-clicking on it.
Description: The player clicks on a cell in the game grid. The UI layer sends the cell coordinates to the game logic layer. The game logic layer processes the action, determines the result, and updates the game state accordingly. If the revealed cell contains a mine, the game ends in a loss. If the revealed cell is empty, adjacent cells are automatically revealed recursively until non-zero adjacent mine counts are encountered.

Use Case: Flag a Cell

User Story: As a player, I want to flag a cell to indicate the presence of a mine.
Description: The player right-clicks on a cell in the game grid. The UI layer sends the cell coordinates to the game logic layer. The game logic layer toggles the flagged status of the cell, updates the game state, and notifies the UI layer to display the flagged cell accordingly.

Use Case: Win the Game

User Story: As a player, I want to win the game by successfully flagging all mines and revealing all safe cells.
Description: The player strategically flags all cells that contain mines and reveals all remaining safe cells without detonating any mines. The game logic layer verifies the win condition by checking if all mine cells are flagged and all non-mine cells are revealed. If the win condition is met, the game ends in a win.

Use Case: Load a Saved Game

User Story: As a player, I want to load a previously saved game of Minesweeper.
Description: The player selects the "Load Game" option from the menu. The persistence layer retrieves the saved game data and restores the game state. The UI layer updates the display to reflect the loaded game state.

Use Case: Get a Hint

User Story: As a player, I want to receive a hint to help me make the next move.
Description: The player clicks a "Hint" button or selects the hint option from the menu. If the AI layer is implemented, it analyzes the game state and provides a hint to the player, such as suggesting a safe cell to reveal or a mine to flag. The UI layer displays the hint to the player.

These are just a few examples of potential use cases and user stories for a Minesweeper game. The specific use cases and user stories may vary based on the desired features and functionality of the game.

Game Structure and Architecture: The initial setup of the project, including setting up the file structure, creating classes, and establishing the architecture, could take around 4-8 hours.

User Interface (UI) Implementation: Developing the UI components, including the game grid, buttons, timer, and score display, might take approximately 6-12 hours.

Game Logic and Algorithms: Implementing the core game logic, such as generating the minefield, handling cell reveals and flagging, checking win/loss conditions, and calculating adjacent mine counts, could require about 10-20 hours.

AI Component (Hint System): If you plan to include an AI component to provide hints to the player, it might take an additional 8-16 hours, depending on the complexity of the AI algorithms.

Storage Management: Implementing the functionality to save and load game progress might require around 4-8 hours, depending on the chosen storage mechanism (e.g., local storage, server-side storage).

Testing and Bug Fixing: Allocating time for thorough testing, bug fixing, and ensuring a smooth user experience is essential. Plan for approximately 8-16 hours for this phase.

Considering these estimates, the total development effort could range from **approximately 40 to 80 hours**. This estimation is a rough guideline and may vary based on individual development speed, familiarity with the technologies used, and the level of polish and refinement desired for the final product.

It's crucial to note that development estimates are subject to change based on project-specific requirements, unforeseen complexities, and individual development styles. It's always recommended to perform a detailed analysis of the project requirements and consult with the developer to obtain a more accurate estimate for a specific development timeline.

```

Explanation of the Code Structure:

src/: Contains the source code for the Minesweeper game.

components/: Contains the components responsible for rendering the game grid and individual cells.
game/: Contains the game logic components, such as the main game logic and an optional AI component for hints (if implemented).
ui/: Contains components responsible for managing the user interface and handling user interactions.
persistence/: Contains components responsible for data storage and retrieval, including saving and loading game states.
utils/: Contains utility functions or helper classes that assist with various tasks, such as grid manipulation or calculations.
main.js: The entry point of the application that initializes and starts the game.
tests/: Contains unit tests for the codebase.

The test folder structure mirrors the source code structure, with corresponding test files for each component.
Unit tests are written using a testing framework (e.g., Jest) to ensure the correctness of individual components and functionalities.
This code structure promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to develop and maintain the codebase. Each component has its own folder, allowing for focused development and testing. The main entry point initializes the game and connects the different components together.

Remember that this is just an example code structure, and you can adapt it to fit the specific requirements of your project or coding practices.

## Code Samples

### main.js

Here's an example code for the main.js file, which serves as the entry point for the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

import UIController from './ui/UIController.js';

// Create an instance of the UIController
const uiController = new UIController();

// Initialize the game
uiController.initialize();

// Start the game
uiController.startGame();

```

In this code snippet, the main.js file imports the UIController class from the UIController.js file. It then creates an instance of the UIController and assigns it to the uiController variable.

Next, the code calls the initialize() method of the UIController instance. This method sets up the user interface, event listeners, and any necessary initializations.

Finally, the code calls the startGame() method of the UIController instance to begin the Minesweeper game.

This code assumes that the UIController class is responsible for managing the overall game flow, user interface, and interaction between different game components. Adjust the code as needed based on your specific implementation and class structure.

  }

  setupGameBoard() {
    // Implement the code to create the game board UI, including cells and any necessary elements
    // You can use DOM manipulation techniques or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js
  }

  attachEventListeners() {
    // Implement the code to attach event listeners to relevant UI elements
    // For example, listen for click events on cells to handle cell reveal or flagging
    // You can use native JavaScript event listeners or framework-specific event handling mechanisms
  }

  startGame() {
    // Implement the code to start the Minesweeper game
    this.gameLogic.startGame();
    // You can call necessary methods from the game logic component or any other relevant component here
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various game actions, UI updates, or user interactions
}

export default UIController;

```

In this sample code, the UIController class is responsible for managing the user interface and handling user interactions for the Minesweeper game. It has methods for initialization, setting up the game board UI, attaching event listeners, and starting the game.

Note that this is a basic example, and you may need to extend the UIController class with additional methods and properties to handle more specific game functionalities or UI updates. The implementation details will depend on your chosen technology stack (e.g., native JavaScript, React, Vue.js) and design decisions.

Remember to adapt the code to match your specific project requirements and coding style.

### GameLogic.js

Here's an example of a GameLogic.js file that handles the game logic for the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

class GameLogic {
  constructor() {
    this.grid = [];
    this.gameOver = false;
    // Add any additional properties or dependencies here
  }

  startGame() {
    // Implement the code to start a new game
    this.generateGrid();
    this.placeMines();
    // Add any additional setup or initialization steps here
  }

  generateGrid() {
    // Implement the code to generate the game grid
    // The grid should consist of cells, each containing information about whether it's a mine, adjacent mine count, etc.
  }

  placeMines() {
    // Implement the code to randomly place mines on the game grid
    // Ensure that the number of mines and their positions are determined based on the game's difficulty level
  }

  revealCell(row, col) {
    // Implement the code to reveal a cell on the game grid
    // Handle the case when a mine is revealed and end the game if necessary
    // Update the adjacent mine counts for the neighboring cells
    // Handle any additional logic related to cell reveal, such as checking for a win condition
  }

  flagCell(row, col) {
    // Implement the code to flag/unflag a cell on the game grid
    // Update the flag state of the cell and handle any related logic
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various game actions, calculations, or updates
}

export default GameLogic;

```

In this sample code, the GameLogic class handles the core game logic for the Minesweeper game. It includes methods for starting a new game, generating the game grid, placing mines, revealing cells, flagging cells, and potentially more.

### GameGrid.js

Here's an example of a GameGrid.js file that represents the game grid and handles rendering the grid UI for the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

class GameGrid {
  constructor(rows, cols) {
    this.rows = rows;
    this.cols = cols;
    this.grid = [];
    // Add any additional properties or dependencies here
  }

  initialize() {
    // Implement the code to initialize the game grid
    this.createGrid();
    // Add any additional setup or initialization steps here
  }

  createGrid() {
    // Implement the code to create the grid array with cells
    for (let row = 0; row < this.rows; row++) {
      this.grid[row] = [];
      for (let col = 0; col < this.cols; col++) {
        this.grid[row][col] = {
          isMine: false,
          adjacentMines: 0,
          revealed: false,
          flagged: false,
          // Add any additional cell properties as needed
        };
      }
    }
  }

  render() {
    // Implement the code to render the game grid UI
    // This can be done using DOM manipulation or by utilizing a front-end framework like React or Vue.js
    // Iterate through the grid array and generate the UI elements for each cell, applying appropriate styles and classes
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various grid actions, UI updates, or calculations
}

export default GameGrid;

```

In this example code, the GameGrid class represents the game grid and handles rendering the grid UI for the Minesweeper game. It includes methods for initializing the grid, creating the grid array with cells, and rendering the grid UI.

Note that this is a basic example, and you may need to extend the GameGrid class with additional methods and properties to handle more specific grid functionalities, cell interactions, or UI updates. The implementation details will depend on your chosen technology stack (e.g., native JavaScript, React, Vue.js) and design decisions.

```javascript

class AI {
  constructor(gameLogic) {
    this.gameLogic = gameLogic;
    // Add any additional properties or dependencies here
  }

  getHint() {
    // Implement the code to get a hint from the AI
    // Analyze the game state and return a cell that the AI suggests to be revealed or flagged
    // You can use various algorithms or strategies to determine the hint, such as analyzing the probability of mines
    // Return the coordinates (row, col) of the cell that the AI suggests
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various AI actions, calculations, or strategies
}

export default AI;

```

In this example code, the AI class represents an AI component for providing hints in the Minesweeper game. It takes an instance of the GameLogic class as a dependency to analyze the game state and make suggestions.

The getHint() method is responsible for returning a hint from the AI. It can analyze the game state using various algorithms or strategies to determine the suggested cell to reveal or flag. The method should return the coordinates (row, col) of the cell that the AI suggests.

Please note that this is a basic example, and the implementation details of the AI class may vary based on your specific project requirements and AI strategies. You can extend the class with additional methods or properties to handle other AI actions, calculations, or strategies.

Determine the set of cells that are not revealed yet and do not have a flag.
This set of cells represents the possible moves that the AI can suggest to the player.

Evaluate Cell Scores:

Assign a score to each of the possible moves based on the likelihood of the cell being safe or containing a mine.
The score can be determined by analyzing the adjacent revealed cells and their mine counts.
Higher scores can indicate a higher probability of being safe, while lower scores can suggest a higher probability of containing a mine.
Sort Moves by Score:

Sort the possible moves in descending order based on their scores.
This step helps prioritize the moves that are more likely to be safe.

Provide Hint to Player:

Once the moves are sorted, the AI can suggest the cell with the highest score to the player as a hint.
The suggested move can be highlighted or visually indicated to attract the player's attention.

User Interaction:

When the player interacts with the suggested move, the game logic should handle the reveal or flagging of the cell as per the player's action.
It's important to note that the AI for the hint system can be as simple or as complex as desired. The above approach provides a basic foundation for implementing a hint system. However, you can enhance the AI by incorporating more sophisticated algorithms or strategies, such as considering patterns, analyzing probabilities, or even implementing machine learning techniques.

Remember to thoroughly test the AI component to ensure it provides helpful and accurate hints to the player, enhancing the gaming experience without compromising the challenge.

Here's an example code structure for the AI component in the hint system of the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

class AI {
  constructor(gameGrid) {
    this.gameGrid = gameGrid;
  }

  suggestMove() {
    const possibleMoves = this.identifyPossibleMoves();
    const scoredMoves = this.evaluateCellScores(possibleMoves);
    const sortedMoves = this.sortMovesByScore(scoredMoves);
    const hintCell = sortedMoves[0]; // Select the move with the highest score as the hint
    return hintCell;
  }

  identifyPossibleMoves() {
    const possibleMoves = [];
    // Iterate through the game grid to find unrevealed cells without a flag
    // Add those cells to the possibleMoves array
    // Example:
    for (let row = 0; row < this.gameGrid.rows; row++) {
      for (let col = 0; col < this.gameGrid.cols; col++) {
        const cell = this.gameGrid.getCell(row, col);
        if (!cell.revealed && !cell.flagged) {
          possibleMoves.push(cell);
        }
      }
    }
    return possibleMoves;
  }

  evaluateCellScores(possibleMoves) {
    const scoredMoves = [];
    // Iterate through the possibleMoves array and assign scores to each cell
    // based on the adjacent revealed cells and their mine counts
    // Example:
    for (const cell of possibleMoves) {
      const score = this.calculateCellScore(cell);
      scoredMoves.push({ cell, score });
    }
    return scoredMoves;
  }

  calculateCellScore(cell) {
    // Calculate the score for a given cell based on the adjacent revealed cells
    // and their mine counts
    // Example:
    let score = 0;
    const adjacentCells = this.gameGrid.getAdjacentCells(cell.row, cell.col);
    for (const adjacentCell of adjacentCells) {
      if (adjacentCell.revealed) {
        score += adjacentCell.mineCount;
      }
    }
    return score;
  }

  sortMovesByScore(scoredMoves) {
    // Sort the scoredMoves array in descending order based on the scores
    // Example:
    scoredMoves.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
    return scoredMoves.map((move) => move.cell);
  }
}

```

In this example, the AI class provides the functionality to suggest moves to the player as hints. The suggestMove method orchestrates the AI's decision-making process by calling other helper methods.

The identifyPossibleMoves method finds all unrevealed cells without a flag and returns them as an array. The evaluateCellScores method assigns scores to each possible move based on the adjacent revealed cells and their mine counts. The calculateCellScore method calculates the score for a given cell. The sortMovesByScore method sorts the possible moves in descending order based on their scores.

You can customize and expand upon this code structure to implement additional logic or more sophisticated AI algorithms based on your specific requirements.

Please note that the provided code structure is a simplified example and may need adaptation to fit within your existing codebase or integrate with your game logic.

### UIManager.js

Here's an example of a UIManager.js file that manages the user interface for the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

class UIManager {
  constructor() {
    this.gameGrid = null;
    // Add any additional properties or dependencies here
  }

  initialize(gameGrid) {
    // Initialize the UIManager with the game grid
    this.gameGrid = gameGrid;
    // Add any additional setup or initialization steps here
  }

  render() {
    // Implement the code to render the game interface
    // This can involve rendering the game grid, buttons, score, timer, etc.
    // You can use DOM manipulation or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js for rendering
    // Utilize the game grid's render() method to render the grid UI
    this.gameGrid.render();
    // Add any additional rendering logic or UI updates
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various UI actions, updates, or interactions
}

export default UIManager;

```

In this example code, the UIManager class is responsible for managing the user interface for the Minesweeper game. It includes methods for initializing the UIManager with the game grid, rendering the game interface, and potentially more methods for handling UI actions, updates, or interactions.

The initialize() method is used to initialize the UIManager with the game grid. It takes the game grid as a parameter and sets it as a property of the UIManager for later use.

The render() method is responsible for rendering the game interface. It can involve rendering various UI elements such as the game grid, buttons, score, timer, and any other components. In this example, the render() method calls the render() method of the game grid object to render the grid UI. You can add additional rendering logic or UI updates as needed.

Please note that this is a basic example, and the implementation details of the UIManager class may vary based on your specific project requirements and the chosen technology stack. You can extend the class with additional methods or properties to handle other UI actions, updates, or interactions.

Remember to adapt the code to match your specific project requirements, UI components, and coding style.

### StorageManager.js

Here's an example of a StorageManager.js file that manages the storage and retrieval of game data for the Minesweeper game:

``` javascript

class StorageManager {
  constructor() {
    // Add any necessary properties or dependencies here
  }

  saveGame(gameData) {
    // Implement the code to save the game data
    // Store the game data in the browser's storage (e.g., localStorage) or on the server
  }

  loadGame() {
    // Implement the code to load the saved game data
    // Retrieve the game data from the storage and return it
  }

  clearSavedGame() {
    // Implement the code to clear the saved game data
    // Remove the stored game data from the storage
  }

  // Add more methods as needed to handle various storage actions or operations
}

export default StorageManager;

```

In this example code, the StorageManager class is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of game data for the Minesweeper game. It includes methods for saving the game data, loading the saved game data, and clearing the saved game data.

The saveGame() method is used to save the game data. It takes the game data as a parameter and stores it in the browser's storage (e.g., localStorage) or on the server, depending on your chosen implementation.

The loadGame() method retrieves the saved game data from the storage and returns it.

The clearSavedGame() method removes the stored game data from the storage, allowing the user to start a new game or reset the saved game.

Please note that this is a basic example, and the implementation details of the StorageManager class may vary based on your specific project requirements and storage mechanism. You can extend the class with additional methods or properties to handle other storage actions or operations, such as managing multiple saved games or implementing encryption.

Remember to adapt the code to match your specific project requirements, storage mechanism, and coding style.

### GridUtils.js

 Here's an example of a GridUtils.js file that provides utility functions for manipulating the game grid in the Minesweeper game:

```javascript

class GridUtils {
  static getAdjacentCells(row, col, grid) {
    // Implement the code to get the adjacent cells of a given cell
    // The function should return an array of adjacent cells
    // You can use the row and col parameters to determine the current cell's position
    // The grid parameter represents the game grid array
    // Handle edge cases and ensure that you're not accessing cells outside the grid boundaries
    // Return the array of adjacent cells
  }

  static countAdjacentMines(row, col, grid) {
    // Implement the code to count the number of adjacent mines for a given cell
    // The function should return the count of adjacent mines
    // You can utilize the getAdjacentCells() function to get the adjacent cells of the current cell
    // Check each adjacent cell and count the number of cells that contain mines
    // Return the count of adjacent mines
  }

  // Add more utility functions as needed to handle various grid operations or calculations
}

export default GridUtils;

```

In this example code, the GridUtils class provides utility functions for manipulating the game grid in the Minesweeper game. It includes static methods for getting the adjacent cells of a given cell (getAdjacentCells()) and counting the number of adjacent mines for a given cell (countAdjacentMines()).

The getAdjacentCells() method takes the row and col parameters to determine the position of the current cell. It also takes the grid parameter, which represents the game grid array. The method should handle edge cases, such as cells on the grid boundaries, and return an array of adjacent cells.

The countAdjacentMines() method takes the row and col parameters to determine the position of the current cell. It also takes the grid parameter, which represents the game grid array. The method uses the getAdjacentCells() function to retrieve the adjacent cells of the current cell and counts the number of cells that contain mines. It returns the count of adjacent mines.

Please note that this is a basic example, and the implementation details of the GridUtils class may vary based on your specific project requirements and grid representation. You can extend the class with additional utility functions to handle other grid operations or calculations, such as revealing all adjacent cells or checking for win conditions.

Remember to adapt the code to match your specific project requirements, grid representation, and coding style.

## Test Cases

Here are some example test cases for the Minesweeper software:

Test Case: Reveal Cell

Description: Verify that a cell can be revealed correctly.
Steps:
Create a new instance of the game grid.
Choose a cell to reveal.
Call the revealCell(row, col) method on the game grid, passing the row and column indices of the chosen cell.
Verify that the specified cell is now revealed.
Verify that the adjacent cells are revealed if the chosen cell has no adjacent mines.

Test Case: Flag Cell

Description: Verify that a cell can be flagged and unflagged correctly.
Steps:
Create a new instance of the game grid.
Choose a cell to flag.
Call the flagCell(row, col) method on the game grid, passing the row and column indices of the chosen cell.
Verify that the specified cell is now flagged.
Call the flagCell(row, col) method again on the same cell.
Verify that the flag is removed from the cell.

Test Case: Game Over (Mine Explosion)

Description: Verify that the game ends when a mine is revealed.
Steps:
Create a new instance of the game grid.
Place a mine in a specific cell.
Call the revealCell(row, col) method on the game grid, passing the row and column indices of the cell with the mine.
Verify that the game ends and displays the appropriate message (e.g., "Game Over - You Lost").

Test Case: Game Win (All Cells Revealed)
