## Multiple Images to PDF

Assembling multiple images into a PDF book automatically requires either software tools or scripting. 

Here are several methods across different platforms and use cases:

### 1. **Adobe Acrobat Pro** (Windows/Mac)

1. Open Adobe Acrobat Pro.
2. Go to `File` > `Create` > `Combine Files into a Single PDF`.
3. Add all your images.
4. Arrange them in the desired order.
5. Click on `Combine`.

### 2. **Preview** (Mac)

1. Select all the images you want to combine.
2. Open them all together, and they'll open in Preview in one window but as separate documents.
3. Go to `View` > `Thumbnails` to show page thumbnails.
4. Drag and drop the thumbnails into the correct order.
5. Go to `File` > `Print`.
6. In the Print Dialog, click on the `PDF` button in the lower-left corner and choose `Save as PDF`.

### 3. **Online Tools** (Cross-platform)

Several online tools can help you convert multiple images into a PDF, such as:
- Smallpdf
- ILovePDF
- CombinePDF

Note,  when using online tools, especially with sensitive or private images, as you're uploading them to a third-party server.

### 4. **Scripting with ImageMagick** (Cross-platform)

ImageMagick is a powerful command-line tool that can handle image conversions and manipulations. 

You can use it to convert multiple images into a PDF. 

First, install ImageMagick. Once installed, you can use the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
convert *.jpg output.pdf
```

This command will convert all JPG files in the current directory into a single PDF named `output.pdf`. 
You can adjust the wildcard and file type as needed.

### 5. **Python Script using ReportLab and PIL**:

If you have some programming knowledge, you can write a Python script to automate the process using the `ReportLab` and `Pillow` libraries. 

Here's a simple example:

```python
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter, landscape
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from PIL import Image

images = ["image1.jpg", "image2.png", "image3.jpg"]  # Add your images here
canvas_data = canvas.Canvas("output.pdf", pagesize=landscape(letter))

for image_path in images:
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img_width, img_height = img.size
    aspect = img_height / float(img_width)
    width = landscape(letter)[0]
    height = aspect * width
    canvas_data.drawInlineImage(image_path, 0, landscape(letter)[1] - height, width=width, height=height)
    canvas_data.showPage()

canvas_data.save()
```

This script will take the images listed in the `images` list and assemble them into a PDF named `output.pdf`. 

Ensure you have the required libraries installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install reportlab Pillow
```

These methods can help you automate the process of combining images into a PDF. 

Depending on your specific needs, choose the one that seems most appropriate for you.
