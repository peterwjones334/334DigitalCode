## Python Code Generator

This example will generate a Python script that reads a file and prints its contents.

### Step 1: Create the Code Generator

Here's the Python code generator that generates the target script:

```python
import os

def generate_script(output_path, file_to_read):
    script_content = f"""\
import sys

def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            contents = file.read()
        print(contents)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {{file_path}} not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {{e}}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python generated_script.py <file_to_read>")
    else:
        file_path = sys.argv[1]
        read_file(file_path)

# Automatically generated script to read and print file contents
# File to read: {file_to_read}
"""
    with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(script_content)
    print(f"Script written to {output_path}")

# Example usage
output_path = "generated_script.py"
file_to_read = "example.txt"
generate_script(output_path, file_to_read)
```

### Step 2: Run the Code Generator

Running the above code will generate a script named generated_script.py. The generated script will look like this:

```python
import sys

def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            contents = file.read()
        print(contents)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python generated_script.py <file_to_read>")
    else:
        file_path = sys.argv[1]
        read_file(file_path)

# Automatically generated script to read and print file contents
# File to read: example.txt

```


### Step 3: Execute the Generated Script

To execute the generated script, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
python generated_script.py example.txt
```

This will read the contents of example.txt and print it to the console.

### Notes

Generate_script Function: This function takes two parameters: output_path (the path where the generated script will be saved) and file_to_read (the file that the generated script will read and print).

Script Content: The script content is defined as a multi-line string. It includes a function read_file that reads and prints the contents of the specified file. The script also handles basic error checking.

Write the Script: The function writes the generated script content to the specified output path.
