Some code for credential handling

## GetPass

The getpass module in Python provides a secure way to handle user input for sensitive information, such as passwords or other credentials, without displaying the input on the screen. It is commonly used for command-line interfaces or scripts where user interaction is required.

The primary function provided by the getpass module is getpass.getpass(prompt='Prompt'). It displays the prompt message to the user and then waits for input. Unlike the standard input() function, getpass.getpass() obscures the input, usually by replacing each character with an asterisk (*), preventing it from being displayed on the screen.

Here's a simple example of how to use getpass:

```python

import getpass

# Prompt the user for a password
password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")

# Access the password securely
print("Password:", password)

```

When you run this code, the prompt message "Enter your password:" will be displayed, and the user can type their password securely without the characters being echoed on the screen. The entered password will be stored in the password variable and can be used further in your program.

By using getpass, you can enhance the security of your applications or scripts by ensuring that sensitive user input, like passwords, remains hidden from onlookers or potential security risks.

To read the user ID from a Windows session using Python, you can utilize the getpass module to prompt the user for their username and securely retrieve the input. Here's an example code snippet:

```python

import getpass

# Read the user ID from Windows session
user_id = getpass.getuser()

# Display the user ID
print("User ID:", user_id)
```

When you run this code, it will prompt you to enter your Windows username. Once you provide the input, it will retrieve and display your user ID.

Please note that this code will only work if you are running it on a Windows operating system.

## Passing credentials from a Windows Session

To execute code with your current Windows username and password, using them to connect through a company proxy server and access a web service with Single Sign-On (SSO), you can utilize the requests library in Python, which supports handling proxies and authentication. Here's an example code snippet:

```python

import requests
from requests_ntlm import HttpNtlmAuth

# Proxy server details
proxy_server = 'http://proxy-server-url:port'  # Replace with the actual proxy server URL and port

# Web service URL
web_service_url = 'https://web-service-url'  # Replace with the actual web service URL

# Web service endpoint
web_service_endpoint = '/api/endpoint'  # Replace with the actual endpoint of the web service

# Windows credentials
username = 'your-username'  # Replace with your Windows username
password = 'your-password'  # Replace with your Windows password

# Create a session with proxy settings
session = requests.Session()
session.proxies = {
    'http': proxy_server,
    'https': proxy_server,
}

# Authenticate with Windows credentials
session.auth = HttpNtlmAuth(username, password)

# Make a request to the web service
response = session.get(web_service_url + web_service_endpoint)

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Request successful.')
    print('Response:', response.text)
else:
    print('Error making the request.')
    print('Response:', response.text)
```

Make sure to replace 'http://proxy-server-url:port' with the actual URL and port of your company's proxy server, 'https://web-service-url' with the actual URL of the web service you are accessing, and 'your-username' and 'your-password' with your Windows username and password, respectively.

The code sets up a session with the proxy server and uses NTLM authentication to pass your Windows credentials. It then makes a request to the web service using the session. If the request is successful (status code 200), it prints the response text. Otherwise, it prints an error message along with the response text.

Please note that the exact authentication mechanism and proxy configuration may vary depending on your company's setup. Make sure to adapt the code accordingly to match your specific requirements.

## Reading Proxy Settings from Windows

To read the proxy settings from Windows using Python, you can utilize the winreg module to access the Windows Registry and retrieve the proxy configuration. Here's an example code snippet:

```python

import winreg

# Registry key for Internet Settings
internet_settings_key = winreg.OpenKey(
    winreg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
    r'Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings'
)

# Read the ProxyEnable value (0 or 1)
proxy_enabled = winreg.QueryValueEx(internet_settings_key, 'ProxyEnable')[0]

if proxy_enabled:
    # Read the ProxyServer value (proxy server address and port)
    proxy_server = winreg.QueryValueEx(internet_settings_key, 'ProxyServer')[0]

    # Read the ProxyOverride value (addresses that bypass the proxy)
    proxy_override = winreg.QueryValueEx(internet_settings_key, 'ProxyOverride')[0]

    # Display the proxy settings
    print("Proxy Server:", proxy_server)
    print("Proxy Override:", proxy_override)
else:
    print("Proxy is not enabled.")

# Close the registry key
winreg.CloseKey(internet_settings_key)
```

This code opens the Windows Registry key for Internet Settings (Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings). It then reads the ProxyEnable value to determine if the proxy is enabled. If it is enabled, it reads the ProxyServer value, which contains the proxy server address and port, and the ProxyOverride value, which specifies addresses that bypass the proxy. Finally, it displays the proxy settings.

Please note that this code retrieves the proxy settings for the current user from the Windows Registry. Keep in mind that the exact registry keys and values may vary depending on the Windows version or the configuration of the system.

## Retrieving Session information from a Browser

Retrieving the username and session identity from the current web browser session is not directly possible using Python alone. The web browser session is managed by the browser itself and is typically not directly accessible by external programs or scripts.

However, if you're working with web applications, you can implement functionality within the web application itself to retrieve the username and session identity. The web application can store user session information and provide an API or endpoint that allows external programs to retrieve session details.

Alternatively, if you have control over the web browser session and the website you are accessing, you can utilize browser automation tools like Selenium to interact with the browser programmatically and extract information such as the username and session identity. Selenium provides a Python API that allows you to automate browser actions and retrieve various data from the web page.

Here's an example of using Selenium WebDriver to extract information from a web page:

```python

from selenium import webdriver

# Initialize the Selenium WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Provide the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

# Open a web page
driver.get('https://example.com')  # Replace with the URL of the web page you want to access

# Extract the username from the web page
username_element = driver.find_element_by_id('username')  # Replace 'username' with the appropriate element ID
username = username_element.get_attribute('value')
print('Username:', username)

# Extract the session identity from the web page
session_element = driver.find_element_by_id('session')  # Replace 'session' with the appropriate element ID
session_identity = session_element.get_attribute('value')
print('Session Identity:', session_identity)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

In this example, we are using the Selenium WebDriver to open a web page and extract the username and session identity from specific HTML elements on the page. You need to replace 'https://example.com' with the actual URL of the web page you want to access and 'username' and 'session' with the appropriate element IDs or other selectors that can uniquely identify the desired information on the page.

Please note that Selenium requires an appropriate WebDriver to interface with the web browser. You need to download and configure the WebDriver for the specific browser you are using (e.g., Chrome WebDriver for Chrome browser).
