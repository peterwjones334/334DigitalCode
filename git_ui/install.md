This setup involves creating a Node.js server that listens for POST requests to execute Git commands. 

The frontend JavaScript sends the command and directory information to the server, which then executes the command and returns the output.

### Initialize a new Node.js project

```bash
mkdir git-command-ui
cd git-command-ui
npm init -y
npm install express body-parser
```

### Create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir server
cd server
touch server.js

```

### Next Steps:

Run the Server: Start the Express server by running node server/server.js.
Test the UI: Open index.html in a browser and test the Git commands.
