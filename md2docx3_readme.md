## Usage:

To use this script, instantiate the MarkdownConverter class with Markdown text and call the convert method.

```python
md_text = "Your markdown text here"
converter = MarkdownConverter(md_text)
doc = converter.convert()
doc.save('output.docx')
```

## Classes and Methods:

MarkdownConverter class

__init__(self, md_text):
Initializes the converter with Markdown text.

convert(self):
Main method to convert Markdown to a Word document and return the Document object.

handle_heading(self, line):
Detects and formats headings.

handle_bullet(self, line):
Detects and formats bullet list items.

handle_hyperlink(self, paragraph, text):
Identifies hyperlinks in text and adds them to the given paragraph in the Word document.

handle_plain_text(self, line):
Adds non-formatted text as a new paragraph.

handle_list(self, lines, current_index):
Processes ordered and unordered lists.

handle_table(self, lines):
Detects and converts Markdown tables to Word tables.

handle_image(self, line):
Inserts images into the Word document with optional titles.

add_hyperlink(self, paragraph, url, text):
Inserts a hyperlink into a paragraph.

## Regex Patterns:

The script uses various regex patterns to identify Markdown elements. For example:

HEADING_PATTERN for headings
LIST_PATTERN for lists
BULLET_PATTERN for bullet points
BLOCKQUOTE_PATTERN for blockquotes
CODE_BLOCK_PATTERN for code blocks
HYPERLINK_PATTERN for hyperlinks
IMAGE_PATTERN for images
TABLE_PATTERN and associated patterns for tables

## Dependencies:

python-docx for creating and manipulating Word documents
re for regular expressions
urlopen from urllib.request for fetching images from URLs
BytesIO from io for handling image streams

## Exception Handling:
The script includes basic exception handling, particularly for image insertion, which may fail if the URL is unreachable or the path is incorrect.

## Customization:

Users can modify the styles and formatting applied to different elements by editing the respective methods.

## Limitations and Known Issues:

The script currently does not support advanced Markdown features like nested lists or complex table structures.
The error handling for image insertion could be improved to provide more detailed feedback.

## Future Work:
Add support for nested lists and more complex Markdown features.
Improve the robustness of network operations and error handling.
Optimize the script for large documents with numerous Markdown elements.
